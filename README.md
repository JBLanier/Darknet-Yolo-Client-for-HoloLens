# Darknet-Yolo-Client-for-HoloLens

AR object annotation using Yolo on HoloLens 1. 

[Demo video](https://jblanier.net/media/HololensDemo.mp4) (filmed through the HoloLens 1 as the current api didn't allow for simultaneous camera use by both this app and recording software)

This client relies on serverside CNN inference using [this server](https://github.com/JBLanier/Darknet-Yolo-Server-for-HoloLens).

This is a Unity game engine project using the HoloLens 1 libraries.

This undergrad research project isn't actively maintained, but if you want to deploy this to your HoloLens, this appears to be a good [starting point tutorial](https://medium.com/@mkryaz/step-by-step-hololens-1-with-unity-and-visual-studio-tutorial-4601d5dfcc8f) to launching a HoloLens 1 project with Unity and Visual Studio on Windows. 

I don't have access to a HoloLens anymore, but I'm happy to help get this running is best as I can (johnblanier@gmail.com).
