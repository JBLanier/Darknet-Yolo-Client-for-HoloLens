# Darknet-Yolo-Client-for-HoloLens

AR object annotation using Yolo on Hololens 1. 

[Demo video](https://jblanier.net/media/HololensDemo.mp4) (filmed through the Hololens 1 as the current api didn't allow for simultaneous camera use by both this app and recording software)

This client relies on serverside CNN inference using [this server](https://github.com/JBLanier/Darknet-Yolo-Server-for-HoloLens).
